      <p>This technique relates to Success Criterion 2.2.6 Timeouts.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to enable people with disabilities to start and complete a task, taking breaks as needed, without losing any data. People with cognitive limitations, low vision, motor impairments or blindness may not be able to complete a process in one sitting. They may need to take a break and then return to complete the task. A timeout that occurs after user inactivity of 20 hours or greater, allows for breaks that are needed by some people with disabilities.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
			    <li>While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, the user has cognitive fatigue and needs to take a break. The user leaves the browser page open to hold their place in the checkout process and takes the break they need. Because there is a 20-hour timeout, the user can return within that 20 hours to complete the checkout and purchase without starting over. </li>
			    <li>While taking an online training course, the user with a motor disability needs to take a break. The user leaves the online training window open to hold their place and takes the break they need. Because there is a 20-hour timeout, the user can return within that 20 hours to complete that training course without starting over.</li>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
				  <li>Identify any digital content that has a time out function due to user inactivity. </li>
					<li>Navigate to that digital content and then interact with that content to the point where you have input user data or reached a point in the task path where a user could want to  return without starting over. </li>
					<li>Then do not interact with that content for 19 hours and 59 minutes.</li>
					<li>At 19 hours and 59 minutes, interact with the content.</li>
					<li>Check that all of the following are true:
					  <ul>
					    <li>Any user data entered in this digital content process has been retained.</li>
					    <li>The user can resume at the place where they left off. </li>
				      </ul>
					</li>
