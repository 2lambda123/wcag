			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to display information that was previously provided by the user or by the system rather than requiring the user to remember the information from a previous step.  This improves success for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities and memory impairments.</p>

				<h3>Display the information from a previous step</h3>
				<p>During a two-step process for setting up a business, the first step provides a business identification number after the user enters a name and address. The second step requires creating a user profile. The interface allows the user to select the business they just set up with all associated information.</p>
