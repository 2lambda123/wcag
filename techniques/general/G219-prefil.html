			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to prefill data entry fields with any information that was previously provided by the user or by the system rather than requiring the user to remember and re-enter the information from a previous step. This improves success for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities and memory impairments.</p>

			<p>This technique best applies when information is often, but not always, the same as information previously entered or provided.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Populate previously entered information with a trigger</h3>
				<p>An ecommerce site provides a checkbox that triggers the shipping address to be pre-populated based on the billing address the user had entered in a previous step. </p>

			</section>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Automatically populate information based on previous answers</h3>
				<p>During a two-step process for setting up a business, the first step provides a business identification number after the user enters a name, and address. The second step requires creating a user profile. The business identification number, name and address are prepopulated. </p>
