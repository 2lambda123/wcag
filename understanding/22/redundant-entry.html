        <h2>Redundant Entry Success Criteria text</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>For information entered by or provided to the user in a process, at least one of the following is true. The information is:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>not requested a second time; or
               <li>auto-populated; or</li>
               <li>available for the user to select.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Exception: Re-entering the information is <a>essential</a>.</p>
            <p class="note">Editors' note: Are there issues storing the data so a user can access it in subsequent parts of a process?</p>
            <p class="note">Editors' note: Are there others exceptions needed than essential? E.g. for mandated or required information re-entry.</p>

        <h2>Intent of Redundant Entry</h2>


        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users can successfully complete processes. It reduces cognitive effort where  information is asked for more than once during a process. It also reduces the need to recall information provided in a previous part of the process.</p>

        <p>This Success Criterion pertains to the current user session, and is not applicable  a user returns after closing a session or navigating away.</p>
        
        <p>Information that is required to be remembered for input can pose a significant barrier to users with cognitive or memory difficulty. All users experience a natural gradual mental fatigue as they proceed through a process. This fatigue is accelerated by the stress of recalling information from short-term working memory. Users with learning, and cognitive disabilities are highly susceptible to mental fatigue.</p>
        
        <p>Requiring people to recall information already entered can cause them to give up or enter incorrect information.</p>
        
        <p>This Success Criterion does not add a requirement to remember information between sessions, a <a>process</a> is defined on the basis of an activity and does not continue across sessions.</p>
        
        <p>There is an exception for essential uses of input re-entry for things like password entry (security), or memory games which would not be possible if the previous answers were supplied.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Redundant Entry</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Users with cognitive disabilities experience short-term, working memory difficulty. Not having to repeatedly remember particular information reduces stress and the likelihood of mistakes.</li>
         <li>Users that experience difficulty forming new memories, recalling information, and other functions related to cognition can complete processes without having to unnecessarily rely on their memory.</li>
      </ul>

   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Redundant Entry</h2>

      <ul>
         <li>A form requests the userâ€™s corporate identification number (ID) in the first page of a process to purchase a new computer. In the 3rd page the user is asked to confirm that the computer will belong to the user (rather than a colleague), and re-shows the ID. It allows the user to change the ID, but defaults to the previously entered one.</li>
         <li>A form on an e-commerce website allows the user to confirm that the billing address and delivery address are the same address.</li>        
      </ul>
